# TryHackMe
These are the notes I took, and reports I wrote about rooms I've completed on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/ "TryHackMe").

I use the following software when working through these exercises:
* [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/ "OpenVPN") - needed for connecting to TryHackMe's Rooms
* [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html "Download VMware Workstation Player") - I use this to run my virtual machine
* [Kali Linux custom image](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/ "Download Kali Linux virtual images") - the VM I run (64 bit)
* [KeepNote](http://keepnote.org/ "KeepNote") - my note taking tool of choice
* [Greenshot](https://getgreenshot.org/ "Greenshot") - a small utility to help me take screenshots faster, and paste them into my KeepNote notebooks
